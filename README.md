## âš¡ About Me :

I am a Flutter and Android devloper, I am very interested in the mobile app developement field.
One of my main goals for the next year is to become a Fullstack mobile developer.
My goals for the coming period are many. 
I wish I could achieve many things from them, why not all of them, but it takes time, learning and patience.
